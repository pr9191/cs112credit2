/*
Signature: PaySalary: double double -> double
Purpose: design recipe to design a C++ function monthlySalary and retroactivePay that expects a number Input
representing a given salary, and outputs the amount of retroactive pay Increase and per month.
tests:(RetroactivePay 40,000) == 1,520;
(RetroactivePay 70,000) == 2,660;
(MonthlySalary 86,000) == 7,439;
(MonthlySalary 90,000) == 7,785;
